#Question 1:

#a.
	grep "&#x2713" foo.html

# grep command helps search for text &#x2713 in file foo.html. Putting &#x2713' helps the system to treat it as string. 
# the option -w makes system to search for word only

#b.
	sed -i  '50,100 s/<th>/<th class="C">/g' foo.html

# i: is option used to save as original file
# 50,100 let system knows that this command is applied to between line 50th to 100th of file
#"/g' is necessary, without this option, it would not replace <th class="C"> if there are more than 1 "<th>" in the same line. For example, <th><th> 

#c.
From the question onward, we assume that the novel file is my_book_20180501.txt 

diff my_book_20180430.txt my_book_20180501.txt

# diff command helps find the different  following by name of two text files (they have to be saved under the same directory).

#d.
sed -n 100,200p my_book_20180501.txt
# without –n,  the system would understand following inputs as pattern, which will crash the command line.
# 100,200p shows at which line command line will operate on/print out 
#file name is my_book_20180501.txt

#e.
sed -i '100,200d' my_book_20180501.txt 
# -i option help overwrites original file. 
# 100,200d shows which line will be deleted in file and “d” is important as it make the system understand that this is a deleting command
# -i option help overwrites original file. 
#file name is my_book_20180501.txt

#Question 2

#!/bin/bash

while read p;

#p is the variable 

do 
	if [ ! -z "$p" ]
 then
	cp $p $( echo $p | sed "s/$p/..\\/..\\/new\\/ACST890_s1_2018_$p.txt/")

#if [ ! -z "$p" ] help to avoid blank line.
#cp command helps copy files from one directory to another
#echo $p is used to print the name for the file which is followed by sed command to change file name
#\\ is used to let the system understand that it is followed by character instead of "/" of command

fi

done < 'current_list'

#"done <'current_list'" appoints where to read values for p
